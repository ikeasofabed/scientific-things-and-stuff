\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {5}{\ignorespaces Schematic diagram of Ariel's 4-Tier ecosystem. Tier 1 will provide the base for selecting Tier 2 planets, which in turn inform the selection of Tier 3 targets. The planets in each Tier will give us deeper insight into the nature of the planets in preceding Tiers. This interdependence among Tiers means that the scientific value of the data collected by Ariel will grow over time. Tier 4 observations will benefit from the insight gained by the planetary populations of the other Tiers and will in turn provide a better understanding of their atmospheric behaviour \cite [p. 40]{arielstudyreport}.}}{7}{figure.caption.9}%
